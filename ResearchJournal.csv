left,Desire of Codes,Surveillance-themed installation that track the viewer with robotic sensors,"Desire of Codes by Seiko Mikami is a large-scale installation where robotic “eyes” equipped with sensors and motion tracking quietly follow the movements of viewers. The work explores surveillance, observation, and how the body becomes data in digital space. I find it both tense and strangely calm. That quiet gaze feels invasive in a subtle way, like being watched and observed without consent. What I love is how it makes invisible systems—like tracking and control—into something physical and spatial. You don’t just see the concept, you walk inside it and feel it watching back.",https://live.staticflickr.com/8287/7779765758_7e619c42d3_b.jpg,,Seiko Mikami – Desire of Codes (2010),,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko_Mikami,"InteractiveArt, Japan, SensorInstallation"
left,teamLab Planets TOKYO,Immersive projection-based space that blends human body and light,"teamLab Planets TOKYO is a large-scale, immersive art museum where viewers walk barefoot through rooms filled with water, mirrors, fog, and digital projections. The boundaries between human body and artwork blur—reflections ripple, lights shift with movement, and space responds like a living organism. Each room slows things down bringing in a sense of wonder, softness, and physical presence. I love how the experience is both overwhelming and meditative. It’s not just about looking, but about being part of something fluid and shifting. The installation turns the body into an interface, making the artwork feel alive through the viewer’s own presence and movement.",https://team-lab.imagewave.pictures/2koqWMtuBSwiHExSLDGrHd?width=1200&format=jpeg,,"teamLab Planets, Tokyo – immersive digital art",,https://mymodernmet.com/digital-art-exhibition-tokyo-teamlab/,"InteractiveArt, Japan, DigitalInstallation"
left,MyWhale,Sound-reactive light installation using oceanic sounds,"MyWhale is an immersive installation by Tundra Studio that surrounds viewers with reactive light and sound. The piece is inspired by the myth of the 52-hertz whale—an unusually solitary creature whose call goes unanswered. Visitors lie down under a ceiling of LED lights that respond in real time to deep, slow soundwaves. The experience feels distant, emotional, and suspended in time. I love how it transforms oceanic stillness into something spatial and sensory—where viewers don’t just hear, but feel the voice of the whale through light, vibration, and quiet space.",https://static.tildacdn.com/tild6166-3531-4237-a633-633966633461/82.jpg,,Tundra - MyWhale(2014),,https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/this-immersive-light-installation-uses-whale-songs-as-a-soundtrack,"SoundArt, Korea, ImmersiveExperience, Tundra"

Using mobile 3D scanning apps and node-based visual coding tools, she reinterprets everyday objects into shimmering digital animations. I love how her works dissolve ordinary things into glittering particles and futuristic textures—it feels like holding a coded universe that sparkles, pixel by pixel.",https://verse.works/image/w3840/static%2Fuploads%2F0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0%2F79f5dcf3-55dc-48ae-9e46-2142d7f9dfae.png@jpeg,,Saeko Ehara – Kirakira Digital Worlds,,https://skohr.works/about,"3DGenerativeArt, JapaneseArtist, Kirakira"
left,Luke & Nik’s Portfolio Website,Dynamic portfolio website with fluid scroll and drag-based layout,"Luke & Nik’s portfolio website is a visually minimal but interactive space that reflects their artistic identity as photographers and directors. The site features a drag-based interface that invites exploration rather than traditional scrolling. A hidden colour selector allows users to subtly personalise the background, adding an unexpected layer of play. I really like how the site feels quiet but dynamic—simple at first glance, but with small gestures that make it feel alive and responsive to the viewer’s curiosity.",https://dvtk.us/media/pages/projects/luke-and-nik/910eabaa6e-1686220755/og-twitter-1200x675-crop-1-q80.jpg,,Luke & Nik – Interactive portfolio website,,https://lukeandnik.co.uk,"WebDesign, Interaction, DragScroll"
left,Málà Project,Cinematic restaurant website with 90s Hong Kong film atmosphere,"Málà Project’s website feels like stepping into a 90s Hong Kong film—bold red tones, grainy textures, and looping cinematic visuals create an atmosphere that’s nostalgic and immersive. The background music and typography add to that vibe, making the whole experience feel more like a mood than just a menu. I love how even the interface feels intentionally timed—clicks and scrolls trigger smooth transitions like scene changes in a movie. It’s expressive, layered, and unapologetically full of flavour, just like the food",https://httpster.net/assets/media/1y/malaproject.com-2-1YUMhH.webp,,Málà Project – Cinematic restaurant website,,https://www.malaproject.com/,"CinematicWeb, HongKongAesthetic, RestaurantDesign"
left,Symphony in Acid,Experimental web music video with coding languages,"Symphony in Acid is a web-based generative music video created by Max Cooper and Ksawery Komputery. Built entirely with HTML and JavaScript, the site reacts to mouse movements and keyboard inputs, transforming Wittgenstein’s Tractatus into glitchy, shifting text animations that move in sync with the music. As the beat plays, letters scatter, flicker, and reform—like code turning into sound, or language glitching into feeling. I love how it feels like poetry written through motion and rhythm.",https://www.stashmedia.tv/wp-content/uploads/Max-Cooper-Symphony-in-Acid-Music-Video-Ksawery-Kirklewski6.jpg,,Symphony in Acid – Web symphony with reactive text,,https://symphonyinacid.net/,"WebVideo, Typography, MusicInteraction"
left,FAN Collective,Playful website with vertical layouts,"FAN Collective is a website for a multidisciplinary design studio working across branding, editorial, and interactive projects. The site feels minimal at first, but there’s a strong sense of rhythm and personality. The navigation is simple and clear, but the vivid colour palette and vertically stacked layout give the site a playful twist—it keeps things moving and interesting without being too much. I like how it balances order and looseness—everything makes sense, but still feels light and exploratory. It’s structured fun, and that contrast really works.",fan.jpg,,FAN Collective – Bold minimalism archive,,https://fan.group/,"MinimalDesign, VerticalLayout, InteractiveWeb"
left,Keller Easterling’s Website,Minimal website with paragraph-like navigation structure,"Keller Easterling’s website reflects her work as an architect and writer—it’s extremely minimal and clean, almost to the point of feeling empty. There are no menus or buttons, just plain text laid out like a paragraph. It’s disorienting at first, but that unfamiliar structure sparks curiosity. Users are invited to slow down, hover, and explore at a different pace. I love how it turns navigation into something closer to reading—a kind of quiet wandering, like moving through a hypertext novel.",https://fiu-original.b-cdn.net/fontsinuse.com/use-images/47/47178/47178.jpeg?filename=9781784783648-6ec9da5299c8902931ed89143270360e.jpg,,Keller Easterling – Text-based interactive portfolio website,,https://www.kellereasterling.com/,"ExperimentalUX, Hypertext, NarrativeWeb"
left,Angelo Plessas’s Website,Quirky website filled with surreal 3D graphics and geometric animations,"Angelo Plessas’s website is maximal and surreal, reflecting his interest in techno-spirituality and the internet as a space for ritual. The layout is dense with colour, shape, and shifting forms, and the geometric, 3D-like visuals give everything a slightly offbeat energy. The cursor is especially reactive, acting like a mischievous character on its own. I love how the site feels like a weird little playground—strange, chaotic, but somehow familiar. It doesn’t tell you where to go; it invites you to drift.",https://www.laforetdartcontemporain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Le-Voyage-De-La-Lune-scaled.jpg,,Angelo Plessas – Surrealism portfolio website,,https://angeloplessas.com/,"SurrealWeb, CursorArt, ExperimentalDesign"

As users type, loosely related images pop up in real time, reacting to keywords in unexpected ways. It feels chaotic but intentional—making the users search for meaning between the text and what appears. I like how it invites interpretation rather than control—it’s messy, funny, and often feels like I'm writing through a stream of visual poetry.",https://info.hktdc.com/sp/designinspire/exhibitor/2023/curaturae-cover.jpg,https://info.hktdc.com/sp/designinspire/exhibitor/2023/curaturae-cover.jpg,Curaturae – Typing-based visual poetry,,https://curaturae.com/,"TextInteraction, RandomImage, Chaos"
left,Schemas of Uncertainty,Experimental website using unpredictable text-based interactions,"Schemas of Uncertainty is a web-based research project that visually explores instability and non-linearity. Shifting layouts, draggable text blocks, and sideways scrolling create a browsing experience that resists control. The constant text motion and red highlights make everything feel unpredictable, even a bit disorienting—but in a way that’s strangely engaging.  I love how the entire page feels unstable, like reading while falling. It keeps me alert, searching for meaning in fragments, embracing the uncertainty it performs.",https://websitetown.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/schemas-of-uncertainty-website-screenshot-1400-1024x640.jpg,,Schemas of Uncertainty – Conceptual website,,https://schemasofuncertainty.com/,"ExperimentalLayout, DragInteraction, WebDesign"

left,Monogatari Series ,Visually experimental anime using surreal symbolism and storytelling,"Monogatari anime series is based on light novels by Nisio Isin, famous for its symbolic use of colours and surreal visuals. The series often shifts its palette from monochrome to saturated schemes and combines digital graphics, hand-drawings and pictures to reflect its narrative tone and characters' emotional states. I love how its visuals distort emotions and space, incorporating diverse sources and colour schemes. It’s unsettling, strange, and eerie. I had inspirations from this for my WorkBook website’s aesthetics.",mono.jpg,https://pm1.aminoapps.com/6549/0e5cbfbc65e41af38689e72b2d3d6fc93cd8e661_hq.jpg,Monogatari – Japanese anime(2009),,https://monogatari-usa.com/,"Anime, VisualSymbolism, SurrealColour, WebsiteInspiration"

His color palette of earthy tones and soft gradients reflects quiet melancholy and beauty. I’m drawn to the visual twist in his work - how slowed down, muted, and quiet tones are suddenly interrupted by bursts of vibrant colour. It reminds me of things that are fading but still beautiful.

Sayaka Shimada collected and analysed data on the dates, times, and locations of the cancelled events, compressing one year into a 365-second fireworks performance. Exhibited at Haneda Airport, the installation combines real launch tubes with drone films to recreate the absent celebrations in an infographic yet emotional way.

It collects online blogs that contain the phrases “I feel” or “I am feeling,” and visualises human emotions based on that data. The emotional data is categorised into six movements and represented through particles, text, images, and colour. I find the idea of translating the subjective and abstract nature of emotion into structured data deeply inspiring.",https://videogamesasartmedium.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wefeelfine.jpg,, Jonathan Harris & Sep Kamvar – We Feel Fine,,http://www.wefeelfine.org/,"DataArt, EmotionMapping, DigitalVisualisation"
